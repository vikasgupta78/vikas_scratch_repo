1. from powershell in admin mode:
a) docker pull tomcat
b) from docker desktop note the image id
c) docker run -p 8080:8080 -t <image id>
e.g. docker run -p 8080:8080 -t ab1f0e1bb1a1
d) http://localhost:8080/  will for now return 404 as no web application deployed by default


----------------

To deploy an application an image needs to be formed with war and which extends docker image of tomcat

https://medium.com/@pra4mesh/deploy-war-in-docker-tomcat-container-b52a3baea448


Each time code changes new docker image would have to be formed


Steps to follow:

1. Make Dockerfile
2. make image

docker image build -t vikas/tomcat_try2_war .

3. run

docker run -p 9090:8080 vikas/tomcat_try2_war

3. Hit

http://localhost:9090/try2


For exploded:

1. Make Dockerfile
(notice that dir names to be written in destination also)

1. docker image build -t vikas/tomcat_try2_exploded .
2. docker run -p 9090:8080 vikas/tomcat_try2_exploded
3. http://localhost:9090/try2_exploded
